## Part 1

- [Short Paper](gavenski-proposal.pdf)

- [Presentation Slides DRIVE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BBN5-JhxRvJ80eKZ7jAteZH73pJXhgdE24SebSVhrGs/edit?usp=sharing)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] Where will you obtain the dataset to train the approach?
- [ ] How will you measure effectiveness?

Stylistic comments: 

- [ ] Avoid passive voice
- [ ] Keep the abstract to the point, focusing on the 4 key aspects [I suggest here](http://www.meneguzzi.eu/felipe/presentations/paper-writing.pdf)
- [ ] Additionally, moreover, furthermore are often (but not always) an indication of poor structure, get rid of them (e.g. I have not found any on your work, but just in case). If you have multiple points to make, enumerate them and tell the reader at the outset what you want.
